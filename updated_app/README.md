This is my first python project, which is basically a database application, which keeps record of score of a cricket match.
Make sure that you copy all the attached files (jpg/png) otherwise the code will not run.
This is a real-time based application, maybe there will be some errors, because I am not much experienced but, I will try my best and keep upgrading this app.
Thank you.
